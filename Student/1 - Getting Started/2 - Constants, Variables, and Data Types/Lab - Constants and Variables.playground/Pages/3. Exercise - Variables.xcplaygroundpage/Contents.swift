## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 12
print(schooling)
//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling += 1
print(schooling)
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("This is different from trying to change a constant because I am telling the computer that value will change when I declare it as a variable, making the compiler accomodate for changes in the computer's memory.")
